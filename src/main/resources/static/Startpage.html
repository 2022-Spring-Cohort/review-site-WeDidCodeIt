                            Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.

                            Interpreted language is a programming language which are generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program. Interpreted language ranges â€“ JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.
